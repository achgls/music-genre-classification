Music genre classification with SENets
========================================
Music genre classification projet as part of the Numerical Analysis for Machine Learning course at Politecnico di Milano, A.Y. 2022-2023.
 

Dataset
-------
The data used for this project can be found
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/achgls/gtzan-music-genre) 
as a Kaggle dataset. It can be downloaded into the `res` directory
directly from the terminal using
[Kaggle's CLI tool](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api):
```console
kaggle datasets download achgls/gtzan-music-genre -p ./res --unzip
```
The GTZAN dataset was originally introduced in the following paper by George Tzanetakis (hence
the name) in 2002 as part of his Ph.D. thesis work.

  journal={IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing}, 
  title={Musical genre classification of audio signals},

```


Reproducibility
---------------
In order to allow for proper uncontaminated assessment of each parameter's impact
on training, the training script present in this repo allows for full reproducibility of experiments.
When modifying a certain parameter to evaluate its impact on training, you can thus be certain
that all other parameters remain stable.
When a seed is given as argument to the script, the model is prevented to use any
non-deterministic operations, and the seed is set as the pseudo-random
number generator for the initialization of models weights as well as data sampling.
You might get a `RuntimeError` from NVIDIA backend when trying to run
reproducible experiments, in that case you will have to set an environment variable as so:
```console
export CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=:4096:8
```

Requirements
------------
Libraries used in this project are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and
can be installed at once with:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
In addition to those,
you need a torchaudio-compatible audio backend installed. This would be `soundfile`
for Windows machines: `pip install soundfile`, and `sox_io` for Unix systems:
`pip install sox`. More info on bakends are available
on the [PyTorch audio backends documentation](https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/backend.html).
